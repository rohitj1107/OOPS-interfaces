Interfaces

interfaces use 'interface' key word not use 'class' key word,
interface only declared not call. interface can not create body in method.
if interface we use in a class that time we use 'implements' key word. for inherit
interface can not create object directly. but class can create object.
we can implements multiple interface in a class
